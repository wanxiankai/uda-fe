        <p>We all know how important content is to any marketing campaign.</p>

        <p>The blog, for example, has become the cornerstone of any successful website; guiding users in with targeted, relevant, and engaging content and ultimately delighting with them so much they convert and subscribe to get more. </p>

        <i>But what if your blog design is missing the mark? </i>

        <p>The fact is, more users will enter your website (and find your brand) via your blog articles than ever your homepage, so <a href="https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/getting-ready-to-launch-a-learning-center">your blog design should put your “best foot forward.”</a> </p>

        <p>That’s one of the main reasons we created our Blog Optimization Package, to quickly give you the ability to revamp your blog and optimize your user’s experience.</p>

        <p>When it comes to blog design, there are a variety of different factors to look at, including font sizes, hierarchy, calls-to-action, and text width, among other things.</p>

        <p>With so many things to take into account, it can be nerve-racking to take on a new blog design (but of course, we can help you with that).</p>

        <p>That’s exactly why I wanted to compile some great examples of user-focused blog design inspiration to help best deliver your content and keep your readers coming back for more!</p>

        <p>Author’s Note: All of these blogs are being viewed on a 13” Macbook Pro. What you view may change based on your screen size. But! It should be a consistent user experience screen to screen. </p>

        <p>The biggest piece of advice I can give when designing your blog for users is make it readable. </p>

        <p>What do I mean by that? Simply put, legibility and digestibility. Use clean fonts, headings, and put the focus on the content.</p>

        <p>Wistia does a great job of this on its blog.</p>
